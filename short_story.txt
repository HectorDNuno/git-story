Mary had a little lamb his fleece was white as snow
and everywhere the child went
the little lamb was sure to go 
he followed her to school one day
which broke the teachers cool
but what a time did they have
that day at school
tisket! tisket! baby
a green and yellow basket 
i sent a letter to my baby 
an on my way i pass it!
